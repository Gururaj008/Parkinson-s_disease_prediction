## üìù Project Overview

This repository contains a **Machine Learning pipeline** for predicting **Parkinson's Disease** based on biomedical voice measurements.  
It demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering.
- Model training & evaluation.
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.
- Model explainability using **SHAP**.

Inspired by the real-world challenge of early disease detection, this project aims to build **interpretable AI solutions for healthcare**.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Parkinson's Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons)
- **Features**: 22 biomedical voice measurements (e.g., `MDVP:Fo(Hz)`, `Jitter`, `Shimmer`, `HNR`).
- **Target**: `status` (1 = Parkinson's, 0 = Healthy).

## üî• Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values (none found).
   - Outlier handling (Winsorization).
   - Skewness correction (Yeo-Johnson).
   - Feature scaling (MinMaxScaler).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmap.
   - Distribution plots.
   - Outlier detection via boxplots.

3. **Model Building & Evaluation**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - GridSearchCV for SVM, Random Forest, KNN.

5. **Explainable AI (XAI)**
   - SHAP analysis to understand feature contributions.
